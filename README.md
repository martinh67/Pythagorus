# Pythagorus

My first assignment for week 4 of Fundamentals of Programming completed **06/12/2020**:

Define a function called hypotenuse that calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle when the other two sides are given. Use this function in a program to determine the length of the hypotenuse for each of the following triangles. The function should take two arguments of type double and return the hypotenuse as a double.
